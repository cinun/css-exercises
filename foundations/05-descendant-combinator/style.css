 /* /*Only the `p` elements that are descendants of the `div` element should have a yellow background, red text, a font size of 20px, and center aligned.*/
 /*
 When using descendants the syntax is 
 .ancestor .contents {
 }

 For this assignment we could have also used these:

div p
div > p
div .text
.container p
 */

.container .text {
    background-color: yellow;
    color: red;
    font-size: 20px;
    text-align: center;
}
